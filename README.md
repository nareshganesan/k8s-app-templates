# Kubernetes practice 

I'm a newbie trying to make my way around Kubernetes, I've been learning and documenting the work. Please feel free to leave a comment or raise an issue here.

### Installation

### Setup

### Application development
This is the most fun part of kubernetes, where we simply template the apps, deploy it inside containers, wrap it in service and expose it to outside world. 

Once we deploy an app as service, kubernetes takes care of the scaling, redundancy management and monitoring the apps.
